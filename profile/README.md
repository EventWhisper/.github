# Welcome to Event Whisper

Event Whisper is a simple, easy to use platform to promote events. We try to make it as easy as possible for everyone to find new events for you and your friends to enjoy. We are always looking for new events to add to our platform, so if you have an interesting calendar, please let us know.

## How it started

Event Whisper was started by a group of hackers who wanted to make it easier to find new events. We were tired of having to search through multiple websites to find events that we were interested in. We wanted to create a platform that would make it easy to find events that we were interested in.

The easiest way to get notified about new events is to get a telegram or whatsapp message. So we started creating a multi channel notification system that would send you a message to your favorite messenger. Messages are send out once a day, so you don't get spammed with messages.

The projects was started at future city hackathon heilbronn.

## Repository structure

The core of the project is the `whisper-core` module. It contains the main logic and the main api for the project.

## Touchpoints

we are currently working on a telegram and a whatsapp bot. We are also working on a web interface to make it easier to add new events.

## Scraper

We are always working on new scrapers to get new events. Scrapers are used to get events from websites and add them to our database. We are always looking for new websites to scrape. If you have a website that you would like us to scrape, please let us know.
